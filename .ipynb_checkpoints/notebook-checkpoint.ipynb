    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing technique usually performed on textual data to determine whether a piece of data is positive, negative, or neutral**. Traditionally, it allows businesses to monitor sentiment in customer feedback and therefore tailor their products or services to match their customers’ needs. This technique is **here applied to YouTube comments to help online content creators monitor their audience’s opinion without reading all the comments under a video**. This is particularly useful for those whose content generates thousands to millions of reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Aims \n",
    "\n",
    "This project has multiple goals that work towards allowing the user to :\n",
    "1. Get an overview of the audience's opinion on a piece of content (**sentiment + emotion classification**), \n",
    "2. Roughly know what is discussed in the comment section (**topic classification**), \n",
    "3. Spot intense negative emotions and take actions (report or ban toxic viewers).\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal situation is for the overview to provide insights on different objective aspects of the video : video, audio, content, length and editing quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Method \n",
    "\n",
    "The key steps of this project are :\n",
    "1. **Data collection using the Youtube API**. Creation of JSON files to design a **NoSQL database using Elasticsearch**. Each comment is a document and one JSON file is created per video (a reference to the video is stored in the document).\n",
    "2. **Data preprocessing** : removal of irrelevant data (unreadable characters and links) and emoji processing to make them classifiable. \n",
    "3. **Data analysis** : sentiment, emotion and topic classification using Tensorflow.\n",
    "4. **Data summarisation in a Kibana dashboard**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results \n",
    "\n",
    "Dashboard sentiment, topics and emotions portrayed under a video’s comment section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools  \n",
    "- NoSQL with Elasticsearch : for its tokenization feature that allows us to search through text.\n",
    "- Jupyter notebook : source code and synthetic explanation of our process.\n",
    "- Kibana : data visualisation (final dashboard).\n",
    "- Youtube API : data collection (video comments).\n",
    "\n",
    "### About this notebook\n",
    "This notebook applies our method on a TEDx Talks video *[When money isn’t real: the 10,000 experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VB39Jo8mAQ)* with **4 690 comments**."
